# Swipe and Slice Game

"Swipe and Slice" is an exciting and interactive game where you use hand gestures to slice falling fruits. The game utilizes MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture recognition and OpenCV for computer vision.

## Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* Numpy

To install the required libraries, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play:

* A fruit will appear at the top of the screen and fall down.
* Use your hand in front of the webcam to "slice" the fruit by swiping in the air.
* Each time you slice a fruit, you earn points.
* If a fruit hits the ground without being sliced, you lose a life.
* The game ends when all lives are lost.

## Key Features:

* Hand Gesture Recognition: The game uses MediaPipeâ€™s hand tracking to detect swipes and movements.
